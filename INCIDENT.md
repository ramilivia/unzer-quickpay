# Scenario

An incident just arose. It seems that some of our services are at least partly failing while others are seemingly working.
Explain what you’d be doing right now, when the issue is identified, and after the problem is fixed.

# Some Remarks

As described on the book Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren (Author who introduced the DORA Metrics) incident response it's at the very core of a team's performance. The DORA acronym stands for:

## 1. Deployment Frequency

Deployment frequency it's about how often a team deploys into production. 

## 2. Lead Time for Changes
## 3. Change Failure Rate (CFR)
## 4. Time To Restore Service (MTTR)
