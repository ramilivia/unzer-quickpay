# Scenario

A senior engineer in your team wants to deploy a new service using AWS Fargate. Another senior engineer in
another team with responsibility for infrastructure wants the service deployed in Kubernetes.
Explain how you would address this situation. What actions would you like to take and why?

# Solution

In order to generate ownership and commitment from all parts, including other members, this type of technical decision should be taken as a team.

The best approach would be to request the two engineers involved to conduct research on the tools and to conduct a knowledge sharing session with the team.

Once the knowledge sharing sessions have happened, a workshop should be facilitated with all members involved, where we are going to fill a matrix with different dimensions for example functionality, pricing, familiarity, community, support, and others. Once the session is concluded, we should have a team decision where everyone is responsible for the outcome.

Engineering Managers should advocate for a safe space for discussion and to enable teams to perform and take informed decisions, instead of taking such important decisions by themselves. The experience and knowledge from all team members could reveal perspectives that were overlooked in an initial investigation phase. Also, it is demonstrated that teams that perform the best are teams with a very developed sense of ownership and accountability.
